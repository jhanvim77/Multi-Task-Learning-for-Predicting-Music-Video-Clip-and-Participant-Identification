# Multi-Task-Learning-for-Predicting-Music-Video-Clip-and-Participant-Identification



## Introduction
Multi-task learning (MTL) allows a model to learn multiple objectives simultaneously, enhancing the learning of shared patterns across tasks. This project applies MTL to the domain of multimedia processing, specifically predicting music video clip types and participant identities. Applications of this model include personalized music recommendations, video indexing, and enhancing multimedia metadata.

## Project Structure
The main files and their functions include:

MTL_accuracy_TTsplit.ipynb: Evaluates the accuracy of the model across training and test splits.


MTL_accuracy_over_epochs.ipynb: Tracks model performance over epochs for both tasks.


clip_pred_rf.ipynb: Implements clip prediction using random forest.

clippred1DCNN.ipynb: Implements clip prediction using a 1D CNN model.


individualmodels1DCNN.ipynb: Contains separate CNN models for each task.


part_pred_rf.ipynb: Implements participant prediction using random forest.


partpred1Dcnn.ipynb: Implements participant prediction using a 1D CNN model.
